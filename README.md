# AI Car Training Simulation

Welcome to the **AI Car Training Simulation** project! This repository features a fascinating simulation built with Vanilla JavaScript that creates a dynamic world where AI-powered cars are trained to drive on the road.

## 🚗 Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of how AI algorithms can be used to train virtual cars to navigate roads within a simulated environment. The focus is on building a visual world from scratch and implementing AI to challenge and refine driving behavior.

## 🛠️ Features

- **World Creation**: A fully interactive and visually engaging world designed with Vanilla JavaScript.
- **AI-Powered Cars**: Cars are equipped with AI algorithms to learn and adapt to driving conditions.
- **Training Mechanism**: AI cars undergo a training process to improve their driving behavior and stay on the road.
- **Customizability**: Easily modify or extend the simulation for your own experiments.

## 🌟 Technologies Used

- **Typescript**: For creating the simulation logic and rendering the world.
- **AI Algorithms**: To implement learning and decision-making for the cars.
- **Browser-Based**: No additional dependencies—runs directly in modern web browsers.
